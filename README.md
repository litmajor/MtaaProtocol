# MtaaDAO — The People's Treasury

> "It’s the kind of project our grandkids will fork."

MtaaDAO is a transparent, community-owned digital treasury built for neighborhoods, by neighborhoods. It blends the power of traditional African chamas with blockchain-backed governance — allowing people to save together, vote together, and grow together.

 🌍 Why MtaaDAO?

In many Kenyan communities ("mtaa"), people face:
- Limited access to reliable financial systems
- Mismanaged or opaque savings groups
- No way to vote on how shared money is spent

MtaaDAO solves this** with:
- 🔐 A shared digital treasury
- 🗳️ Transparent, phone-based voting
- 💸 Easy contributions via M-Pesa or crypto
- 🌱 Real-world utility — from school fees to community projects

🧠 Core Principles

| Pillar            | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Community First  | One person, one vote — verified by phone |
| Transparent Money| Treasury visible to all, programmable   |
| Mobile-First     | Built for phones, not browsers          |
| Forkable         | Any neighborhood can launch their own   |

---

🔧 How It Works

1. **Members contribute** via M-Pesa (KotaniPay) or MiniPay wallets
2. **Funds enter the MtaaDAO treasury smart contract** (holds cUSD)
3. **Anyone can propose** a spending idea
4. **Community votes** (1 person = 1 vote)
5. **If approved, funds are released** to the recipient wallet

Optional: Daily UBI using GoodDollar integration
