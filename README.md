# 🌍 Mtaa DAO

> *"Build with the mtaa, not for it."*  
> A decentralized, trust-based protocol for community savings, micro-treasuries, and collective action in African neighborhoods.

---

## ✨ Overview

**Mtaa DAO** is a protocol for organizing **neighborhood-based micro-communities** — from Kariobangi to Kibra to Kisumu. It allows trusted groups to:

- Pool and manage **shared funds** (school fees, hustle capital, emergencies)
- Vote on **how and when to use** the funds
- Track and grow **reputation** through participation and service
- Onboard new members through local **trust networks**

It's mobile-first, culturally grounded, and built for people who already know how to hustle — just not always with the tools they deserve.

## 🧱 Core Modules

| Module            | Description                                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `VaultFund`       | Smart contract to manage deposits + vault balances   |
| `ProposalEngine`  | Handle requests, voting, and approvals                |
| `ReputationScore` | Reward participation and community contributions     |
| `DisbursementGuard` | Ensure quorum + trust checks before release        |
| `AccessLayer`     | USSD, WhatsApp, or PWA interface for all actions     |

## 📲 User Flow (MVP)

1. **Join DAO** via WhatsApp or USSD  
2. **Contribute** to a shared vault (e.g., Ksh 100/week)  
3. **Earn reputation** by voting, referring, resolving disputes  
4. **Request funds** for emergencies or micro-projects  
5. **Vote** on proposals as a community  
6. **Funds released** if trust & quorum criteria met

## 🔐 Smart Contract Stack

- Network: [Celo](https://celo.org) (mobile-first) or Near / Polygon
- Token System:
  - `mtaaREP`: Voting weight + influence
  - `mtaaVOTE`: Monthly voting right
  - `mtaaCRED`: Non-tradeable “merit receipts”
- Logic:
  - Weighted voting (elders + active youth)
  - Multi-signature fund releases
  - Time-locked contributions and rewards

---

## 🎭 Cultural Layer

- **Language-first**: Swahili, Sheng, or local dialects
- **Metaphors**:
  - Vault = `ghala`
  - Rep = `msimamo`
  - Vote = `sauti`
- **Rituals**: Weekly *shirikisho* voting, monthly offline meetups
- **Dispute resolution** by elders and rep history, not just code
